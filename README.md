## Reflection

This project was developed as per requierment in The Odin Project React curriculum. 

A memory card game where you a player can't choose a Pokemon that has been previously chosen. It is a game that will test just how well your memory can store information.

What made this challenging was fetching pokemon data simultaneously in order to present the Pokemon images simultaneously. What solved it for me was using `Promise.all()`. This project allowed me to learn how to efficiently make API calls in React.
